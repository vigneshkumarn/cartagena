# Cartagena
### This project aimed to build an AI player for the Cartagena game using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and strategy evaluation. The software developed is an exploratory application that includes the game components, rules, user and gameplay options. Human players can challenge the AI player, providing an engaging and interactive gaming experience. Additionally, the AI player can compete against itself to evaluate different strategies, enabling the identification of the most effective strategy.
